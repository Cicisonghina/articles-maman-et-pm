# 7:30 PM: When My Real Productive Sprint Begins

## The kids are asleep. Most parents are watching Netflix. Me? I go to war.

---

## 0. Hard Fork

In my previous articles, I told you about the chaos. The fatigue. The sleepless nights, debugging a stressed mare, the metrics to manage two human tornadoes.

I showed you the terrain. The obstacles. The constraints. The price to pay.

Today, I'm telling you something else: **what happens when everyone is asleep.**

What happens at 7:30 PM, when the bedroom door closes on my children. When silence replaces the screams. When my laptop opens and my real day begins.

Because I don't survive the chaos.

**I turn it into a training ground.**

Those sleepless nights? They teach me to operate under constraint. This constant debugging? It sharpens my product instinct. This management of limited resources? It forges my ability to prioritize.

You thought I was writing about parenthood?

**I'm showing you how I'm becoming a Product Manager.**

Every night. In my kitchen. With a cold cup of tea.

Welcome to my nocturnal sprint.

## 1. Tonight, 8:32 PM - The Productive Silence

"Alright, it's time! Kiss mommy and let's go to your room!"

My oldest resists. My youngest smiles. A slobbery kiss. The door closes.

**Silence.**

Around me, the arena after the battle: toys exploded on the floor, a yogurt-stained table, dishes piled in the sink. The laundry basket is overflowing. The diaper pail awaits. The smell of cabbage soup lingers. I don't even notice it anymore.

I should clean up.

I feel guilty. For 2.5 seconds. Timed.

My body craves a truce. I collapse on the couch. Aching back. Tense muscles. Heavy legs. I've carried my gremlins all day. Little hands stole my dessert.

My body has fought a thousand battles today.

**But my mind? Sharp as a blade.**

My laptop opens before the door is even fully shut. Cries from behind it. Protests. My finger hesitates. I text: "Need help?"

"It's ok, don't worry."

**Perfect.**

Visual Studio Code. Claude. Gemini. LinkedIn.

The night is mine.

## 2. My Personal Backlog - Too Many Projects, Not Enough Sprints

9 tabs. 2 applications. An overflowing to-do list.

Last night, I had decided to sleep. Book, pajamas, lights out. Simple plan. Reasonable plan.

**Plan ignored.**

8:30 PM, my husband disappears with the boys. I open Notion. Just to check one thing. A section to complete. An idea.

Midnight.

Here is my current arsenal:

**Product Manager Portfolio**: In progress. January deadline. Non-negotiable.

**"PM & Mom" Article Series**: 4 published, 5 in progress. Cadence: every 2-3 weeks. Mission: prove my skills through storytelling.

**Active Job Search**: Resume, LinkedIn, offers, applications. Daily monitoring. Networking. A daily battle.

**Carhorsel**: My product. On temporary standby because bedtime is mission impossible right now. My husband and I have postponed the project to calmer days.

**House to Renovate**: Entirely. Incidentally. One day.

And on the other side, the list of sacrifices: **fin swimming** (0 sessions this year), my **mare** who waits for me, and our board games gathering dust. **Ark Nova** is sleeping on the shelf. **Aeon's End** is waiting for us to finish the next scenario. As for a **tidy house**... it has become a myth.

6 active projects. 4 on hold. 2 hours per night. Maximum.

**You have to pick your battles.**

Tonight: Portfolio. A fresh intuition. January is approaching. This project is building my future.

Cleaning? Tomorrow. The pool? Next year. Ark Nova? Sorry, my love, but tonight, Notion wins.

This feeling of having too many projects? It's pure electricity. Stimulation. Overwhelm. Both at the same time.

I wish I had more time. It weighs on me.

Because I can only work **alone**. No screens with the kids. No taking notes without a little thief wanting to draw. Zero flow when I'm not alone.

So I take what I have: 8:30 PM to 11:00 PM, three times a week.

**And I try to fit it all in.**

Spoiler: it doesn't fit.

**But I attack anyway.**

## 3. Ruthless Prioritization - What Creates Value

My laptop. 9 tabs. LinkedIn shows 3 PM offers. Claude and Gemini are waiting. Notion is open to my incomplete portfolio.

**Strategic question: what do I do now?**

My options:

**Option A:** Book. Bed. Sleep. The *wise* option.

**Option B:** Tidy this house. The *responsible* option.

**Option C:** Ark Nova with my husband. Terraforming Mars. The *couple* option.

**Option D:** Articles. Three burning ideas. The *creative* option.

**Option E:** Portfolio. An intuition about the Carhorsel retrospective. The *strategic* option.

I check the time. 8:37 PM.

**I choose E.**

Not because it's urgent. Not because it's easy.

**Because it's about L.**

As in Leverage. Shreyas Doshi's concept that changes everything: some tasks have a massive leverage effect on your future. Others don't.

In Product Management, we call this **prioritizing by impact**. Tonight, my portfolio has the maximum ROI. January is coming. The intuition I have will evaporate if I don't capture it. My brain is already running. Switching context would cost me 20 minutes.

Cleaning? Tomorrow morning. The pool? My shattered body says no. Ark Nova? My husband understands. Saturday, I promise.

I look at the living room. The toys. The dishes. The laundry.

I dive back into Notion.

Tomorrow, I'll clean. Or not.

**Tonight? I build.**

## 4. The Creative Kitchen - My Culinary TDD

Sunday noon. Back from the market. Three butternut squashes. A slice of bacon. Not quite enough for pasta.

**Perfect for a risotto.**

My boys are playing on the balcony with their dad. I can hear them laughing. The autumn sun makes them shine.

We are happy.

Me? **I'm on a mission.**

This risotto is not a meal. It's a project. A hypothesis to test: will my kids like this dish my father used to make for me?

I begin. Sautéed onions. Gently. Bacon for flavor. Pearled rice. The aroma rises. My little one peeks in, intrigued.

**The twist: amaretto instead of white wine.**

I read in my cookbooks that almond and butternut squash pair well. I have a bottle of amaretto lying around.

**I test it.**

A few spoonfuls. Just enough for the almond to coat the squash without overpowering it.

**Test-Driven Development:**

1.  **Hypothesis**: Amaretto + butternut squash = victory
2.  **Test**: Make the risotto, observe
3.  **Feedback**: Count the helpings
4.  **Iteration**: Adjust or validate

I stir. Slowly. I add the broth ladle by ladle. The rice swells. The squash melts. Creamy texture.

I taste it.

**It's good.**

I serve.

My oldest takes a bite. Then another. Normally, he eats and goes back to play.

**This time? He has 5 helpings.**

My youngest? Squinting eyes. A smile from ear to ear. Flattened chin.

That face. I'll never forget it.

**Victory.** Feature validated.

Cooking isn't a chore. It's my lab. A creative project with an ultra-short cycle that recharges me: Idea → Test → Feedback → Success.

In product development, you wait weeks for this feedback. In the kitchen? **Instantaneous**.

Every successful dish is proof that I have the instinct. That I know how to iterate. That I know how to deliver value.

This risotto wasn't just a meal. It was a sprint. **And I won it.**

## 5. Carhorsel - The Product That Grows at Night

Last night, 8:37 PM. Portfolio open. Notion loaded. Claude at my fingertips.

**3 hours ahead of me.**

No development this time. No code. No terminal or Visual Studio. Bedtime is mission impossible right now, so my husband and I have put development on standby.

Tonight, it's about retrospectives.

I review what we've built. I document our learnings. I structure our journey for my portfolio. Missing sections. Rephrasing. Visual presentation. Optimization.

**Carhorsel doesn't sleep. It is forged in the shadows.**

The real magic? It doesn't happen in front of the screen.

It happens in the forest. While walking. Two strollers. A dog on a leash. My husband by my side.

We discuss the business plan. The personas. The architecture. The algorithm. Ideas flow. The kids are either sleeping or babbling. The dog is sniffing. We are building.

**The perfect training ground.**

No distractions. No screen. Just our brains racing and our voices intertwining. We brainstorm for hours. We come home with a complete mental roadmap.

We're just missing one thing: **the screen time to implement it.**

But it will come.

For now, I'm forging my PM skills differently: user research through surveys, late-night competitive analysis, discussions with potential users. I write in a notebook while the kids play. I capture ideas between screams.

**I adapt. I prioritize. I iterate.**

The time constraint makes me better. I have no choice. With only 2 hours a night, potentially interrupted by crying, I don't have the luxury of perfection.

I'm learning to prioritize ruthlessly. To iterate faster. To get "in the zone" in seconds.

**I am becoming a surgeon of productivity.**

Every minute is an instrument. Every action is a precise incision. No superfluous gestures. No time for hesitation. I visualize the goal and I operate. Direct. Clinical. Efficient.

At night, when everyone is asleep and my husband takes over, I type on my keyboard with the precision of a scalpel. Determination in my fingers. Absolute focus.

**I am forging myself.**

Carhorsel grows at night. But so do I.

## 6. These Articles - My Pensieve in Action

Some articles emerge like Legendary Pokémon. Complete from their first appearance. Perfect. Ready for battle.

Others evolve. They start like Eevee and gradually transform depending on the terrain, the training, the evolution stone I give them.

**This article? It's a Dragonite.**

It took 10 hours to get halfway. And it will take just as long to finish. Because it's a centerpiece. Because both substance AND form matter. Because it's the pivot of my entire series.

On other nights, I've written 2 complete articles in one evening. Total flow. Ideas poured out. The words just came. No need to search. Everything was there.

**But this one resists. And that's a good sign.**

When a Pokémon resists, it means it's powerful.

My process?

1.  **Brainstorming with Claude or Gemini**: I rough out the idea, the theme, the angle.
2.  **Capture in bits.md**: I note all relevant anecdotes.
3.  **Structure**: We build the skeleton together.
4.  **Writing**: I type. I rework. I refine.

The problem? **Too many ideas. Not enough time to capture them.**

During the day, I'm with my gremlins. No screen. No peaceful note-taking. My phone? Too slow. My son seeing me with it? "Photo?" every 30 seconds.

I try to take notes while pushing the double stroller with the dog on a leash. Mission impossible, to say the least.

So I store them. In my head. Like an overflowing mental Pensieve.

In the evening, when silence returns, I open my real Pensieve: my computer. And I empty it. I pull out the thoughts. I analyze them. I contemplate them in a new light. I exploit them to build my future.

**And I lighten my mind.**

These articles are not a hobby. They are my weapons.

Every text prepares me for interviews. Every metaphor sharpens my thinking. Every anecdote demonstrates a PM skill that I might not be able to explain in a 45-minute interview with a recruiter.

**My Pensieve is my arsenal.**

And I fill it every night. One thought at a time. One word after another.

## 7. What I Leave Behind (And Why It's OK)

**Fin swimming.** Signed up. Wednesday 8:30 PM. Number of sessions this year: 0.

**Horse riding with Vazy.** My mare is waiting. I don't visit enough.

**Ark Nova on the table.** My husband and I love board games. The box is sleeping.

**A tidy house.** The absolute myth.

I could feel guilty. Tell myself I should do better. That I'm neglecting my body, my mare, my relationship, my home.

**But I don't endure these choices. I make them.**

Every evening, I consciously say no. Not out of surrender. Out of strategy.

In Product Management, this is called **conscious technical debt**.

You develop a feature quickly with Python to validate a hypothesis. You *know* you'll have to refactor it later in a more performant language. But you choose speed of delivery now over perfection tomorrow.

Because **shipping fast > shipping perfect**.

It's the same for me.

I *know* my house is a construction site. I *know* my back needs exercise. I *know* my relationship deserves time. I *know* Vazy would like to see me more often.

But I choose to build my professional future **now**. And deal with the rest... later.

**Saying no is a PM skill.**

A Product Manager spends their life saying no. To features that don't create value. To requests that distract the team. To projects that dilute the vision.

I train every night.

No to cleaning. No to Netflix. No to immediate rest.

**Yes to what builds.**

The difference between endured debt and conscious debt?

One destroys you. The other, you control.

I know what I'm leaving behind. I know why. And I know when I'll come back to it.

**As soon as I sign my PM contract, I'll dive back into the pool.**

Promise.

## 8. The Nocturnal Flow - When I'm Most Productive

Last night, past midnight. My back was screaming. My eyes were stinging. My fingers were typing.

**My brain? On fire.**

The absolute paradox: physically wrecked, mentally sharp as a blade.

My husband takes the dog out. "Are you coming to bed?"

I look up from the screen. A second. Two.

"Just 5 more minutes."

**I could have gone on until dawn.**

This is the nocturnal flow. That state where time disappears. Where ideas chain together. Where each keystroke resonates like a precise blow in a karate kata.

Precise. Fluid. Unstoppable.

2 hours of nocturnal flow are worth 8 scattered hours during the day. Why?

**The silence.** No "Mommy!" every 30 seconds.

**The deadline.** The dog needs to go out. My husband is waiting. At 10 PM, it's over. No choice.

**The pure motivation.** No one is forcing me. It's MY choice. MY quest.

**The solitude.** Finally alone with my thoughts. No context switching. Zero interruptions. Pure flow.

I see myself as Rocky. *Eye of the Tiger* on a loop in my head. I type on my keyboard like he hits the punching bag. Imaginary raincoat. Real sweat. Total determination.

**Every line of mental code counts. Every forged word trains me.**

During the day, with the kids? Impossible to channel this flow. Too much context switching. Too many interruptions. My mind bounces like a ball between ten simultaneous emergencies.

But at night?

**At night, I am a warrior at the peak of her game.**

This paradox is my competitive advantage. My ability to perform despite fatigue. To stay focused despite constraints. To produce the maximum with minimal resources.

**Exactly what a Product Manager does every day.**

Managing exhausted teams. Delivering despite constraints. Prioritizing under pressure. Staying lucid when everything is collapsing.

I train every night.

In my kitchen. With a cold cup of tea. While the world sleeps.

**I forge my flow.**

## 9. Resource Management - How I Keep Up the Pace

The question I get asked: "But do you ever rest?"

The answer: **I rest by creating.**

Netflix would drain me. Scrolling on Instagram would exhaust me. Watching series would leave me empty.

**But creating? Creating recharges me.**

Last night, I was exhausted. Aching back. Stinging eyes. 3 hours of work on my portfolio.

The result? **More energized than before.**

Not physically. My body was even more battered. But mentally?

**Recharged. Satisfied. Alive.**

Why?

Because I had **produced**. Built. Moved forward. Forged my future with my own hands.

The ROI on my energy was maximal.

I manage my energy like a product. Every activity has a cost. Every activity has a benefit. I calculate. I prioritize. I optimize.

**Cleaning?** Cost: 1h. Benefit: clean house for 24h. ROI: low.

**Portfolio?** Cost: 3h. Benefit: PM career advancement. ROI: **huge**.

**Netflix?** Cost: 2h. Benefit: temporary distraction. ROI: negative.

**Creating?** Cost: 3h. Benefit: mental energy + project advancement. ROI: **infinite**.

I'm not a masochist. I have limits. There are nights when I say "fuck it, I'm sleeping."

When my body is truly at its end. When my mind can't keep up. When I feel that pushing would be counterproductive.

**But those nights are rare.**

Because creation carries me. Because building my future gives me energy. Because every typed line is a victory.

**A Product Manager must know how to manage their energy over the long term.**

Knowing when to push. When to rest. When to sprint. When to recover.

I've been training for months.

I know how to read my gauges. I know when I can handle 3 hours of flow. I know when to let go.

**And above all: I know that creating recharges me far more than consuming.**

It's my secret. My advantage. My strength.

**I don't survive. I forge myself.**

## 10. Conclusion - I Am Not Just a Mom

Every night, I deploy an insane amount of energy to build.

Alone. In my kitchen. With a cold cup of tea.

**Why?**

Because I've always dreamed of being a mom. And I love it. Truly.

But I am not **just** a mom.

I am a **woman**. An **intellectual**. A **creative**. A **social being**. An **athlete** (well, I try). A **warrior** who refuses to choose just one facet.

I am many things at once.

And that's precisely what makes me want to get up in the morning: **not being limited to one role, one facet, one interest.**

When the kids are asleep and I open my laptop instead of Netflix, it's not because I'm fleeing motherhood.

**It's because I need to nourish all these other parts of myself.**

The mother who cuddles her children at 7 AM and the PM who structures a roadmap at 8 PM?

**They are the same person.**

And these two facets feed each other.

My mom skills teach me user empathy. My PM rigor structures my days with the gremlins. My daily chaos forges my ability to prioritize under constraint.

**I no longer choose between my identities. I merge them.**

This ability to juggle my facets, to prioritize without giving up, to build in the gaps...

**This is exactly what a Product Manager does every day.**

Except I'm already doing it.

In my kitchen. At 7:30 PM. With Netflix closed and Notion open.

What I want now?

**To channel this energy within a team setting.**

To build products with others. To have the infrastructure, the resources, the users. To no longer be alone in front of my screen, but surrounded by a team that shares the same vision.

My evening sprint ends at 10 PM.

**My next professional sprint begins now.**

And this time, I won't be alone.

**I will be whole.**
