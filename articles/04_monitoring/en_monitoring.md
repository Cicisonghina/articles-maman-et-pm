# Being a Mom Made Me a Better Product Owner: My 5 Survival Metrics

## How my product management skills survived the ultimate stress test: parenting.

### At 6:30 AM, my first critical incident of the day

My husband's alarm goes off. In the darkness of our bedroom, I hold my breath. The first metric of the day has just been triggered: **the time it takes for my husband to turn off his alarm**. It's not always measured in seconds. Sometimes not even in minutes, but in tens of minutes.

And during that time? I'm like a Prometheus server on high alert, all my sensors awake. Will they hear it? Will I manage to squeeze out another 30 minutes of peace (or even sleep after a restless night)?

Then, the first cry. Often at the very moment my husband walks out the door. My **response time** must be less than 3 milliseconds if I hope to avoid a double wake-up call. The goal: extract the early bird from the bedroom, change him, cuddle him, and prepare breakfast. When his brother wakes up too, it will be harder to give each the attention they need, leading to... tears.

*Critical fail.*

Welcome to my mental Grafana dashboard. The one I’ve been monitoring 24/7 since I became a mother.

### My Family Monitoring Architecture

In Product Management, we measure everything. Conversion rates, churn, user engagement, response times. "You can only manage what you measure," they say.

Becoming a mother is discovering that you also become a walking monitoring infrastructure. A Prometheus that never sleeps, with hypersensitive sensors and an Alertmanager with particularly... sensitive warning thresholds.

Here are my five (main) daily survival metrics.

---

### Metric #1: Mean Time Between Wakeups (MTBW)

**Target value:** 10 hours  
**Current best performance:** 2 hours  
**SLA met:** Never

This metric measures the average time between nighttime wake-ups. In an ideal world, my "end-users" (the children) wouldn't send me any requests between 9 PM and 7 AM. In reality, my system receives alerts every two hours. Sometimes more often.

*"Mom, I'm thirsty."* *"Mom, I had a nightmare."* *"Mom, where are you?"*

What this metric teaches me as a PO: **100% availability has an unsustainable cost**. I have to make conscious trade-offs. I choose to temporarily degrade a non-essential service (my sleep) to guarantee performance on a critical KPI: my users' satisfaction and security.

### Metric #2: Diaper Criticality Level

**Scale:** Green → Orange → Red → Code Brown  
**Critical resolution time:** < 2 minutes

Ah, incident management. When is it going to overflow? Do we have time to finish this task, or do we need to interrupt everything immediately to avoid disaster?

This metric requires constant evaluation and quick decision-making based on weak signals: the smell, the child's behavior, the time since the last change.

In Product Management, we talk about "technical debt." Here, it's... organic debt. The longer you wait, the more complex and costly the resolution becomes. A diaper overflow is a P0 incident that mobilizes all resources: a full change of clothes, an emergency bath, an unplanned laundry load.

What this metric teaches me as a PO: **anticipating a problem is infinitely cheaper than managing a crisis**. Proactive monitoring and preventive maintenance don't just save bodysuits; they save resources.

---

### Metric #3: Decibel Critical Threshold

**High alert:** Pain? Danger? Extreme fatigue?  
**Low alert:** Silence = Mischief in progress

This metric is fascinating because it requires bidirectional interpretation. Too much noise triggers an alert. But *not enough noise* does too.

When the volume exceeds 85 decibels, I switch to emergency intervention mode. Something is wrong. Someone is hurt, scared, or emotionally overloaded.

But when silence reigns for too long in the next room? That's an alert too. A silent child is a child testing the limits of physics with a tube of sunscreen and the fabric sofa.

What this metric teaches me as a PO: **anomalies aren't always in the noise**. The absence of a signal is critical data. A product with no user feedback (neither positive nor negative) is a product whose true health is unknown.

---

### Metric #4: Time to Fall Asleep (TTFA)

**Objective:** < 15 minutes  
**Average reality:** 65 minutes  
**[Degraded mode]:** 2 hours (with multiple retries)

This metric measures the time it takes to finally place a sleeping child in their bed without them instantly waking up. It's a delicate process that requires perfect timing, flawless technical execution, and risk management with every creak of the floorboards.

Some nights, after three failed attempts, I sit on the floor in the dark, a sleeping child in my arms, wondering if I'll spend the entire night in this position.

What this metric teaches me as a PO: **the last mile is often the most critical**. A product that works perfectly in staging (the sleeping child) can fail in production (the bed). My strategy therefore includes progressive rollouts, quick rollback plans (picking him back up), and most importantly, post-mortem analysis to iterate and improve the process with each attempt.

---

### Metric #5: Mom's Response Time

**Contractual SLA:** Immediate  
**Actual response time:** Depends on the time of day, the number of teas consumed, and the accumulated sleep debt.

*"Mom!"*

My response time determines everything: avoiding the double wake-up call, de-escalating a fight before it starts, catching a fall, comforting before the tears become inconsolable.

It's a permanent race against time. And unlike an IT system, I can't scale horizontally by adding more instances. I'm a unique, non-replicable resource. But I try to scale a little more vertically every day.

What this metric teaches me as a PO: **the best reactivity is proactivity**. The better you know your product and your users, the more you can anticipate their needs and deliver value before they even have to ask for it.

### From Family Chaos to Product Strategy

In the end, these metrics are proof that **being a parent is like being the Product Owner of a constantly evolving product with demanding users and no documentation.**

The skills are the same:
- **Prioritize** under extreme pressure
- **Decode** the real need behind the request
- **Anticipate** risks before they become crises
- **Iterate** quickly, because what worked yesterday is already obsolete
- Accept that **"done"** is always better than **"perfect"**

My tea is cold and my dashboard is full of warnings. But the system is stable, and the users are satisfied.

**Ready to see how I apply this resilience and product vision to a digital environment?**

I am currently refining my strategy for my next professional challenge, with availability starting January 2025.
