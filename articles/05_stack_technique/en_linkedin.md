This morning, 8:47 AM, strategic contemplation in front of the bathtub.
My husband: "Did you just talk about our laundry like it's a CI/CD pipeline?"
Me: "Yes. And we're in production outage."
Two weeks later: washer-dryer combo usually sold to McDonald's. â‚¬1,200. Calculated ROI: 730h saved per year.
Build vs Buy applied to real life.
As a future Product Owner, I'll spend my days making these types of decisions: develop in-house or buy an existing solution?
As a mother of two boys, I'm already making these decisions. Several times a day. With tight budgets, limited resources, and immediate consequences.
In my latest article, I share:
â†’ How a washing machine becomes critical infrastructure
â†’ Why I waited 6 months too long to buy a double stroller (technical debt = back pain)
â†’ The 3 tech products I'd like to build for the equestrian world
â†’ The decision framework: when to buy vs when to build
The difference between my family decisions and my future product decisions? Nobody asks me to make a three-slide business case. But the reasoning is exactly the same.
My family tech stack is my Product Owner training ground.
Every washing machine bought, every stroller tested, every product imagined: a miniature product decision.
What about youâ€”what material investment saved you the most time in daily life?
