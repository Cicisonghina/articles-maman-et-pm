# The Family Tech Stack: When Choosing Your Tools Becomes a Product Owner Skill

## This morning, 8:47 AM, strategic contemplation

One month before my second son was born, I'm standing in front of the bathtub. Inside: a pile of damp laundry desperately waiting to be hung. Behind me: the washing machine already running the next cycle. At my feet: the laundry basket still overflowing.

My husband joins me. We look at each other. We look at the bathtub. We look at the basket.

"We have a throughput problem," I say.

My husband looks at me. "Did you just talk about our laundry like it's a CI/CD pipeline?"

"Yes. And we're in production outage."

Two weeks later, we have a washer-dryer combo usually sold to McDonald's. The salesman assured us that if it could handle frying oil smells, infant digestion odors wouldn't stand a chance.

Welcome to my family tech stack.

## Build vs Buy: The framework nobody teaches you in school

As a future Product Owner, I'll spend my days making these types of decisions: do we develop in-house, or do we buy an existing solution?

As a mother of two boys, I'm already making these types of decisions. Several times a day. With tight budgets, limited resources, and immediate consequences.

The difference? Nobody asks me to make a three-slide business case. But the reasoning is exactly the same.

**Buy** is when you invest in an existing solution to solve a problem. **Build** is when you construct your own solution because none exists or none exactly meets your need.

And in between? That's where it gets interesting.

## Critical infrastructure: when the washing machine becomes your CI/CD pipeline

Our first son was an overflow champion. I still don't know how he does it, but his diapers defy the laws of physics. Onesies turn over fast. Very fast.

Our options:
- **Buy more onesies**: not compatible with our values (kids grow too fast)
- **Improve the wash-dry process**: higher initial investment, but quick ROI

We did the math. Time saved per day: ~2h (combined wash + dry vs wash + wait + hang + wait). Over a year: ~730h. Machine cost: ~â‚¬1,200.

ROI: obvious.

But most importantly: **critical availability**. With two kids, I can't afford laundry downtime. It's like a production system: if the pipeline goes down, everything stops.

Our McDonald's washer-dryer is my cloud infrastructure. High capacity, remotely programmable (mobile app), quiet (nighttime deployments possible), energy-efficient. The specs are solid. And so far, it's really keeping up with the pace.

**What this teaches me as a PO:**

Investing in infrastructure isn't sexy. It's not visible. But it's what allows you to scale. A good product rests on solid foundations. And sometimes, the best feature is the one that keeps the system running without you thinking about it.

## Scaling hardware: stroller evolution as capacity planning

**V1 - The inherited stroller**: Gift from cousins. Thin wheels, stuck as soon as there's mud. Problem: I spend 90% of my time in the forest. Solution inadequate for the use case.

**Buy Decision V2**: All-terrain stroller, big wheels. Game changer. Cost: ~â‚¬300. Impact: full access to my favorite playgrounds. Immediate ROI.

**V3 - The scaling problem**: Second baby arrives. Initial solution: baby carrier. Baby born at 5kg, exponential curve. My back: wrecked. Hypothesis: "My toddler will soon listen to me and walk beside me."

Spoiler: no.

Result: impossible to go out with both. I stay locked inside. Unacceptable for someone who lives outdoors.

**Buy Decision V3**: Used double stroller. Timing: **6 months too late**. Why? Because I underestimated the problem. Because I thought I could "optimize otherwise". Because I forgot the basic rule of capacity planning: anticipate future load, not just manage current load.

**What this teaches me as a PO:**

Technical debt is also this. It's like playing birds without looking at their synergies in Wingspan: you lay cards now, but your engine never really takes off. Postponing a necessary investment because you think you'll manage otherwise. Result: 6 months of back pain, failed outings, frustration. The real cost of "I'll wait a bit longer" is always higher than you think.

Anticipating future needs isn't luxury. It's pragmatism.

## "Build" mentality: when no solution exists on the market

During my entrepreneurial adventure in saddle-fitting, I met professionals whose needs have never been addressed by tech. People working with analog tools because nobody thought of them.

Three product ideas running through my head:

**Product 1 - Horse measurement app:**
We take horse measurements with a flexible curve. Report on paper. Search which saddle tree corresponds. Test. Long, imprecise, frustrating process.

My idea: mobile app that analyzes a photo of the flexible curve and suggests compatible trees by brand. Massive time savings. Error reduction. Easy client data storage.

**Product 2 - 3D horse evolution scan:**
Equine health professionals want to track muscular evolution, detect swelling, compare over time. Today: visual observation, palpation, approximate photos.

My idea: 3D scan via smartphone, automatic comparison, highlighting evolved areas. High technical complexity, but real need.

**Product 3 - Carhorsel:**
The real pain point of saddle-fitters? Appointment booking and route organization. Optimize routes, manage availability, avoid gaps in the schedule.

Built solution: connection platform + logistics optimization. Because no existing tool solved this specific problem.

**What this teaches me as a PO:**

The best product opportunity is the one nobody has addressed yet. But identifying a problem isn't enough. You must validate that the need is real, that users are ready to pay (in money or time), and that you have the resources to build.

Build is a long-term commitment. Unlike Buy, you can't just change suppliers if it doesn't work.

## Buy vs Build: the decision framework

When to buy an existing solution?
- The problem is common (many people have the same need)
- Proven solutions already exist
- Acquisition cost is lower than development cost
- It's not your core business

When to build your own solution?
- The need is unique or very specific
- No existing solution really answers the problem
- It's a potential competitive advantage
- You have the resources and passion to do it

**Family example:**
- Strollers: **Buy**. Common problem, mature market, proven solutions.
- Carhorsel: **Build**. Specific need, niche market, differentiating opportunity.

The real skill isn't knowing how to code or tinker. It's knowing **when** it's better to buy and **when** it's better to build.

## Maintenance & Total Cost of Ownership

Buying a solution is never "buy and forget".

My washing machine requires maintenance. My double stroller has tires to check. My digital tools have subscriptions.

Building is even worse. Carhorsel is code to maintain, bugs to fix, features to add, users to support.

**Total Cost of Ownership** is this: initial cost + all recurring costs over the product's lifetime.

A â‚¬1,200 washing machine that breaks down every 6 months ultimately costs more than an ultra-reliable â‚¬1,800 model.

A free product with 10h of configuration and 2h of monthly maintenance costs more than a turnkey paid product.

**What this teaches me as a PO:**

When you evaluate a solution (Buy or Build), never look just at the acquisition cost. Look at the total cost over 3 years. How much maintenance time? What scalability? What obsolescence risk?

The cheapest decisions in the short term are often the most expensive in the long term.

## What my family tech stack teaches me

Every day, I make investment decisions under constraint. Limited budget. Limited time. Limited energy.

I must choose: do I buy this solution or do I build it myself? Do I invest now or later? Do I prioritize speed or quality?

I don't make these decisions in a PowerPoint. I make them in the chaos of an apartment with two screaming kids and a barking dog.

And paradoxically, that's exactly what prepares me to become a Product Owner.

Because managing a product is never in ideal conditions. It's under pressure. With limited resources. Trying to maximize impact while minimizing cost.

My family tech stack is my training ground. Every washing machine bought, every stroller tested, every product imagined is a miniature product decision.

And now, I know I can make these decisions. Because I'm already making them. Every day.
