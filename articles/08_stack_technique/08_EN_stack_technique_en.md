# The Family Tech Stack: When Choosing Your Tools Becomes a Product Manager Skill

## This morning, 8:47 AM, strategic contemplation

One month before my second son was born, I'm standing in front of the bathtub. Inside: a pile of damp laundry. Behind me: the washing machine already running. At my feet: the overflowing laundry basket.

My husband joins me. We look at each other. We look at the bathtub.

"We have a throughput problem," I say.

My husband looks at me. "Did you just talk about our laundry like it's a CI/CD pipeline?"

"Yes. And we're in a production outage."

Two weeks later, we had an industrial-grade washer-dryer. Welcome to my family tech stack.

## Build vs. Buy: The Framework That Forges Strategists

A Product Manager spends their days making these types of decisions: do we develop in-house, or do we buy an existing solution?

As a mother, I'm already making these decisions. Several times a day. With tight budgets, limited resources, and immediate consequences. The reasoning is exactly the same.

**Buy** is when you invest in an existing solution. **Build** is when you forge your own because none meets the need. This is where a PM's real work begins.

## Critical Infrastructure: The Washing Machine as a CI/CD Pipeline

With two kids, I can't afford laundry downtime. It's a production system: if the pipeline goes down, everything stops. So we invested in our infrastructure: a powerful, programmable, quiet washer-dryer.

**What this forges in me as a PM:**

Investing in infrastructure isn't sexy. But it's what allows you to scale. A good product rests on solid foundations. And sometimes, the best feature is the one that keeps the system running without you thinking about it.

## Scaling Hardware: Stroller Evolution as Capacity Planning

**V1 - The inherited stroller:** Unfit for my primary use case (the forest).
**V2 - The all-terrain stroller:** A game-changer with immediate ROI.
**V3 - The double stroller:** Purchased **6 months too late.**

Why? I underestimated future load. I thought I could "optimize otherwise." I accumulated technical debt on my own back. The result: 6 months of frustration and failed outings. The real cost of "we'll see later" is always higher than you think.

**What this forges in me as a PM:**

Anticipating future needs isn't a luxury; it's pragmatism. Postponing a necessary investment costs dearly, not just in money, but in missed opportunities and user satisfaction (in this case, mine). It's what differentiates a PM who reacts from a PM who builds.

## The "Build" Mentality: When No Solution Exists

During my entrepreneurial adventure, I encountered professionals whose needs had never been addressed by tech. This led to the idea for **Carhorsel**, a platform to optimize saddle-fitters' routes. We chose to **build** because no existing tool solved this specific problem.

**What this forges in me as a PM:**

The best product opportunity is often the one no one has addressed. But identifying a problem isn't enough. You must validate the need and ensure you have the resources. *Build* is a long-term commitment.

## Maintenance & Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Buying a solution is never "buy and forget." A ‚Ç¨1,200 washing machine that breaks down every 6 months costs more than a reliable ‚Ç¨1,800 model.

**What this forges in me as a PM:**

When evaluating a solution, never look just at the acquisition cost. Look at the total cost over 3 years: maintenance, scalability, obsolescence risk. A good PM thinks in TCO, not in purchase price.

## What My Family Tech Stack Forges in Me

Every day, I make investment decisions under constraint. I must choose: buy or build? Now or later? Speed or quality?

I don't make these decisions in a PowerPoint. I make them in the chaos of an apartment with two screaming kids. And that is precisely what forges me as a Product Manager.

Because managing a product is never in ideal conditions. It's under pressure, with limited resources, maximizing impact while minimizing cost.

My family tech stack is my training ground. I don't just know I can make these decisions. **I am already making them. Every day.**

These skills aren't theoretical. I forge them in the fire of action.
