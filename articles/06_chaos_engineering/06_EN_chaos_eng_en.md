# From Chaos Engineering to Parenthood: When My Kids Forge My Resilience

## At ManoMano, I injected failures into systems to test their resilience. Now I don't need to inject anything. My kids do it for me.

### This morning, 10:23 AM, grooming area

Everything was perfectly orchestrated. After a catastrophic morning, I'd gathered my courage and taken my two boys to see Vazy, my mare. The plan was going smoothly.

And then. The unexpected.

Victor the golden retriever arrives at full speed. He tries to play with the brush, sends it flying into the water. My son falls. The dog, enthusiastic, knocks my little one over, then climbs into the car‚Äîcovered in mud.

Everyone's crying. My mare is on high alert. Victor is very proud of himself.

Me? One thing is certain: welcome to my involuntary Chaos Engineering laboratory.

## Chaos Engineering 101: When Breaking Things Becomes a Skill

Chaos Engineering is the art of deliberately introducing failures into a system to verify it can handle them. The goal: identify weak points before they become critical incidents in the middle of the night, as I described in my [**InfernalOps Nights**](https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/infernalops-nights-480eca32629f).

A family with two children is the same thing. Except the failures aren't simulated, they're constant, and the system runs 24/7. It's my arena.

## My Personal Chaos Monkeys: Family Fuzzing

At Netflix, "Chaos Monkeys" kill servers to force teams to build resilient systems. At home, I have two Chaos Monkeys. They don't kill servers, they spill tea, corrupt clean laundry, and hack the intercom.

**Scenario 1: Well-Intentioned Help**
My oldest loves to "help." He empties the clean washing machine directly into the dirty laundry bin. It's pure error injection.

**Scenario 2: The Tea Spill**
He wants to smell all my teas. Result: total chaos. And I have to clean while the baby crawls toward the disaster, a perfect demonstration of [**Parental Resource Management**](https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/parental-resource-management-14c5c6192ec1) under constraint.

**Scenario 3: The Junior Hacker**
My oldest sets the intercom to silent mode. Result: the diaper delivery person arrives, we don't hear them. There's no rollback possible.

## Family Blast Radius: The Incident Cascade

The golden retriever cascade is a textbook case of uncontrolled *blast radius*. An initial incident that propagates and puts the entire system in degraded mode.

It's what happens when a microservice fails and all dependencies start failing. Except here, I don't have a Grafana dashboard, just the [**five survival metrics**](https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/being-a-mom-made-me-a-better-product-owner-my-5-survival-metrics-073c22990cee) I constantly track in my head.

## Parental Circuit Breakers: Knowing When to Cut the System

A circuit breaker automatically cuts the flow when the system is overloaded. The other morning, everyone was on edge. I activated the family circuit breaker: I strapped everyone into the stroller and went to see Vazy. Radical context change. And it worked.

This isn't abandonment. It's a strategic maneuver to prevent a critical incident.

## Resilience Patterns: Strategies That Keep the System Running

Certain resilience patterns become automatic mechanisms that keep the system functioning even when everything goes sideways.

* **Occupational bread:** A cache to occupy the CPU (the child) while I process other requests.
* **No-pants mode:** *Graceful degradation*. We accept a degraded mode to avoid complete failure.
* **Double stock:** Redundancy. If one component fails, the backup takes over.

These patterns aren't glamorous. They're the foundations of a resilient system.

## Blameless Post-Mortem: Transforming Failure into Learning

Visits to the grandparents are our recurring post-mortem. We systematically debrief. Not to find someone to blame. To identify the *root cause* and improve monitoring. No blame, just *learnings*.

## Parental Antifragility: Becoming Stronger BECAUSE of Chaos

Antifragility is when a system becomes stronger because of stress. Each family micro-catastrophe makes me more resilient. Because chaos doesn't weaken the system: it forges it.

## What This Teaches Me as a Product Manager

I no longer endure chaos to learn how to build resilient systems. **I master it.**

A good product isn't one that never breaks down. It's one that knows how to handle failures and keep functioning. As a future Product Manager, I won't just "manage" products. I will build fortresses.

Because every day, I pilot a complex distributed system with unpredictable components, constant failures, and zero rollback possibility.

**This isn't a simulation. It's the forge. And it is the proof that I know how to build products that don't crumble under pressure.**

**About Me**

*I'm Cecilia, former Chaos Engineer, former Cloud Engineer, former entrepreneur, and Product Manager. From voluntary Chaos Engineering to involuntary parental chaos, I learned that resilience is built through adversity.*

**I am available now for new challenges in Product Management.**
