# I Launched My Company and Found Out I Was Pregnant the Same Week

## How My Entrepreneurial Failure Became My Best Product Manager Bootcamp

### This Wednesday morning, 10:32 AM

I've just followed up for the umpteenth time with the legal service that's supposed to help me close my company. It's been going on for a year. A year of paying someone to help me get out of this administrative quagmire.

My tea is getting cold on the corner of my desk. Again. I reread the email I just sent and realize something: this endless administrative situation might be the last lesson my company had to teach me.

Because the accountant before them? Recommended by my father and his friends. "A trusted professional," they said. He basically screwed me over for two years: overpriced invoices, sloppy work, everything at the last minute, zero digitalization, and that paternalistic way of treating me like I'd come to play at being an entrepreneur between birthday parties. Young woman in a world of established old men = perfect target for polite scamming.

Here's what nobody tells you about entrepreneurship: sometimes the best lessons come from the biggest failures. And my failure has a particularity: I launched my equine saddle-fitting business on a Tuesday. I found out I was pregnant on Wednesday.

Timing *impeccable*. Really.

## The Shortest Sprint of My Life

Starting a company while pregnant is like launching a product with an immovable, non-negotiable deadline: in 9 months, no matter what, a new critical user will arrive and monopolize 100% of your resources. No buffer. No backup sprint. Just you, your growing belly, and the naive hope that you'll manage to scale before production catches fire.

Spoiler: it didn't scale.

But what I learned during this condensed sprint is worth all the Product Manager bootcamps in the world. Here are my six major lessons, presented with the lucid hindsight of someone who survived the adventure and decided to turn it into their superpower.

## Lesson 1: Stakeholder Management 101 - The Hard Way

**What I learned:** Trusting recommendations is good. Checking Google reviews before signing is better.

My accountant was a reference. In my father's network. Me? I was a statistical anomaly: young, female, and operating in an atypical sector (equine saddle-fitting, seriously, who does that?). Result: he treated me like a second-tier file. Non-digitized paperwork, ignored deadlines, and barely veiled condescension. The legal service afterwards, same battle. A year later, I'm still doing the customer service myself.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

A toxic or incompetent stakeholder costs more than a good provider. As a PM, **my role is to de-risk the project**, and that starts with choosing the right partners. This experience taught me to create my own evaluation grid, beyond recommendations. I now know how to identify red flags:

  - Lack of digitalization = risk of disorganization.
  - Non-proactive communication about blockers = absence of product culture.
  - And most importantly: **recommendations are biased social proof**. What works for one user segment can be harmful for another. You have to validate, test, and keep a critical eye.

## Lesson 2: User Research Under Extreme Conditions

**What I learned:** Understanding your users is easy in theory. Doing it when you're shy, pregnant, and selling a service in a demanding microcosm is another level.

Before, I was an engineer. I talked to machines. Entrepreneurship forced me to "farm" communication skills at an accelerated pace. Each client was a live user research session: Discovery, Retention, Churn analysis. I was alone on the front line to adapt my service, maximize satisfaction, and stay viable.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

User empathy isn't a buzzword. It's a skill that develops by stepping out of your comfort zone. This ability to understand unspoken needs, I had already forged it with [**Vazy, my mare**](https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/debugging-a-stressed-mare-50f70f98c644) — my first real lesson in user empathy with a non-verbal being. As a PM, I know how to ask the right questions and listen between the lines to differentiate the **latent need** (the *'job-to-be-done'*) from the **explicit request** — a fundamental distinction for building a high-value product. And most importantly, I know that the best user research is conducted continuously.

## Lesson 3: Marketing & Self-Promotion - Or How to Learn to Sell Yourself Without Cringe

**What I learned:** If you don't talk about your product, no one else will do it for you.

Creating a website, managing social media, producing content, pitching my concept to suppliers to create strategic partnerships... everything was new. The hardest part? Learning to sell MYSELF. In a trust-based sector, people buy a personality as much as a service. In one year, I surpassed the visibility of my established competitors, not by magic, but through iteration: format testing, engagement analysis, tone adjustment. It was **artisanal A/B testing**, and it worked.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

An incredible product that remains invisible is a dead product. As a Product Manager, I'll also be responsible for positioning, messaging, and the ability to bring stakeholders along. Knowing how to pitch and tell a story to highlight what makes the product unique is a strength I acquired in the field, forcing myself to sell my services when I would have preferred to hide behind a screen.

## Lesson 4: Supply Chain & Vendor Management - Or How to Create Value Through Your Network

**What I learned:** A good product is also a good ecosystem of partners.

Managing supplier relationships is much more than placing orders. It's understanding their constraints, pitching your vision, and negotiating. The partnership I formed with Maison Fairfax (high-end English saddler), for example, wasn't just a commercial victory; it was validation that I knew how to convince established players to follow me.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

A Product Manager orchestrates an ecosystem: tech, business, external partners, APIs... Knowing how to identify the right stakeholders and negotiate win-win collaborations is a strategic skill. The best feature isn't always the one you develop in-house, but sometimes the one you get through the right partnership at the right time.

## Lesson 5: Self-Knowledge as Personal Product-Market Fit

**What I learned:** Loving your sector isn't enough if the job doesn't nourish you intellectually.

I loved horses and my profession. In reality? I quickly felt I was hitting a ceiling. My thirst for solving complex problems wasn't quenched. The work, although exciting in the field, was too isolated and didn't allow me to fully exploit my strategic skills. I needed to build something that scales, collaborate in a team, and measure a broader impact.

And it's from this awareness that **Carhorsel** was born, the main case study in my portfolio: a project that finally combines everything I am. Tech, business, user impact, teamwork, intellectual complexity. A project that nourishes me as much as it serves my users.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

A Product Manager who doesn't understand their own "why" risks building misaligned products. This search for my own **'personal Product-Market Fit'** is what guarantees today that I can build aligned products, meaningful for users and for the team. That clarity is worth all the agile frameworks in the world.

## Lesson 6: Resilience & Pivot - Or How to Bounce Back When Everything Collapses

**What I learned:** Failures are feedback. Expensive, painful, but feedback nonetheless.

Incompetent accountant, dragging legal service, exploding costs... On paper, it's a series of failures. In fact, it's a series of accelerated learnings. Closing my first company wasn't game over. It was a pivot. A painful pivot that makes me more lucid, more agile, and more resilient today.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

*Fail fast, learn faster*: it's a product mantra, but it's also a life posture. My first company closed, but I come out of it with skills and clarity I would never have acquired otherwise. This ability to bounce back and transform blockers into learnings is my competitive advantage. Today, this resilience is forged daily in [**my involuntary Chaos Engineering laboratory**](https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/from-chaos-engineering-to-parenthood-when-my-kids-inject-failures-for-me) — my children. The real question isn't "will it fail?" but **"what do we learn when it fails?"**.

-----

## Conclusion: Closing to Better Open

When I look back at this entrepreneurial year, I no longer see a failure. I see an intensive bootcamp whose intensity no training could ever reproduce.

I understand tech. I understand business. I understand humans. And I know these three dimensions cannot be treated separately.

My saddle-fitting company closed, but what it taught me continues to feed my product vision. And frankly, it might be the best thing that could have happened to me.
