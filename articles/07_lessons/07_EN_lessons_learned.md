# I Launched My Company and Found Out I Was Pregnant the Same Week

## How My Entrepreneurial Failure Became My Best Product Manager Bootcamp

### This Wednesday morning, 10:32 AM

I've just followed up for the umpteenth time with the legal service that's supposed to help me close my company. It's been going on for a year. A year of paying someone to help me get out of this administrative quagmire.

My tea is getting cold. Again. And I realize: this endless situation might be the last lesson my company had to teach me.

Here's what nobody tells you about entrepreneurship: sometimes the best lessons come from the biggest failures. And mine has a particularity: I launched my business on a Tuesday. I found out I was pregnant on Wednesday. Impeccable timing.

## The Shortest Sprint of My Life

Starting a company while pregnant is like launching a product with an immovable deadline: in 9 months, a new critical user will arrive and monopolize 100% of your resources. No buffer.

Spoiler: it didn't scale.

But what I learned during this condensed sprint is worth all the bootcamps in the world. Here are my six major lessons, transformed into superpowers.

-----

## Lesson 1: Stakeholder Management - The Hard Way

**The Skill I Forged:** A toxic stakeholder costs more than a good one. A PM's role is to **de-risk the project**, starting with choosing the right partners. This experience taught me to create my own evaluation grid, beyond recommendations. I know how to identify red flags and that recommendations are biased social proof. You have to validate, test, and keep a critical eye.

-----

## Lesson 2: User Research Under Extreme Conditions

**The Skill I Forged:** User empathy isn't a buzzword; it's a skill developed by stepping out of your comfort zone. This ability to understand unspoken needs was already forged with [**Vazy, my mare**](https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/debugging-a-stressed-mare-50f70f98c644) ‚Äî my first real lesson in user empathy with a non-verbal being. As a PM, I know how to ask the right questions to differentiate the **latent need** (the *'job-to-be-done'*) from the **explicit request**‚Äîa fundamental distinction for building a high-value product.

-----

## Lesson 3: Marketing & Self-Promotion

**The Skill I Forged:** An incredible product that remains invisible is a dead product. As a Product Manager, I'll also be responsible for positioning and messaging. Knowing how to pitch and tell a story to highlight what makes the product unique is a strength I acquired in the field, forcing myself to sell my services when I'd have preferred to hide behind a screen.

-----

## Lesson 4: Supply Chain & Vendor Management

**The Skill I Forged:** A Product Manager orchestrates an ecosystem. Knowing how to identify the right stakeholders and negotiate win-win collaborations is a strategic skill. The best feature isn't always the one you develop in-house, but sometimes the one you get through the right partnership at the right time.

-----

## Lesson 5: Self-Knowledge as Personal Product-Market Fit

**The Skill I Forged:** A PM who doesn't understand their own "why" risks building misaligned products. My thirst for solving complex problems wasn't quenched by my former job. This realization led to **Carhorsel**, the main case study in my portfolio. This search for my own **'personal Product-Market Fit'** ensures I can build meaningful products. That clarity is worth all the agile frameworks in the world.

-----

## Lesson 6: Resilience & Pivot

**The Skill I Forged:** *Fail fast, learn faster*. Failures are feedback. Closing my first company wasn't game over; it was a pivot. Today, this resilience is forged daily in [**my involuntary Chaos Engineering laboratory**](https://medium.com/@cecidimaulo/from-chaos-engineering-to-parenthood-when-my-kids-inject-failures-for-me) ‚Äî my children. The real question isn't "will it fail?" but **"what do we learn when it fails?"**.

## Conclusion: Closing to Better Forge

When I look back at this entrepreneurial year, I no longer see a failure. I see an intensive bootcamp. My company closed, but what it taught me continues to feed my product vision. And frankly, it might be the best thing that could have happened to me.
