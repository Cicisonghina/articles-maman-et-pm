# Project Manager & Mom: The Arena Guide

## My resume looked like a zigzag. I decided to turn it into a frontline.

### This morning, 7:23 AM

My son refuses to get dressed. My tea is getting cold. My mental dashboard is flashing red. And as I negotiate with a 27-month-old stakeholder with an inflexible product vision (the Spider-Man t-shirt. The dirty one. Obviously.), I catch myself thinking: "This isn't a struggle. This is training."

Welcome to my series **"Project Manager & Mom"**. This isn't a diary. It's a combat portfolio. The demonstration, with supporting evidence, that my daily chaos is my best training ground to become a Product Manager.

### The "Hard Fork": Why This Series Changed Its Face

The first articles in this series were about how I *survived* chaos. They set the scene: the fatigue, the doubts, the DevOps-style nights, and debugging non-verbal users. That was the assessment, the playground.

And then, I pivoted. A narrative "Hard Fork."

I stopped enduring. I started transforming.

This series now chronicles how I actively turn every constraint into a skill, every crisis into a lesson, and every sleepless night into a weapon for my PM arsenal. You are not reading the confessions of a tired mom. You are reading the training log of a future product leader.

### The Narrative Arc: From Observation to Conquest

Each article is a step in my quest. From diagnosing the terrain to mastering the weapons.

### Who is this series for?

**For you, recruiting a Product Manager.**
My career path isn't a zigzag. It's a forge.
**Tech (Ubisoft, ManoMano)** gave me the foundations. **Entrepreneurship** taught me the field. **Motherhood** tested my resilience beyond all limits.
**Product Management is the synthesis.** The blade I've sharpened in the fire of these three experiences. This series isn't a resume. It's a series of successfully passed stress tests. If you're looking for a PM who doesn't crumble when production is on fire, you're in the right place.

**For you, in transition and filled with doubt.**
Your "non-professional" experiences aren't gaps in your resume. They are hidden dojos. I'll show you how to find the lens to turn your struggles into superpowers.
