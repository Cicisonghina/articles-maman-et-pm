# I launched my business on a Tuesday and found out I was pregnant on a Wednesday.
## How my failed startup became the best Product Owner bootcamp I ever had.

### That Wednesday morning, 10:32 AM

I've just followed up for the umpteenth time with the legal service that's supposed to be helping me shut down my company. It's been a year. A year of paying people to help me get out of this administrative quicksand.

My tea is getting cold on the corner of my desk. Again. I reread the email I just sent and realize something: this never-ending administrative mess might be the last lesson my business had to teach me.

Because the accountant before them? Recommended by my father and his friends. "A trusted professional," they said. What he mostly did was make a fool of me for two years: steep invoices, sloppy work, everything at the last minute, zero digitalization, and a paternalistic way of treating me as if I were just playing entrepreneur between birthday parties. A young woman in a world of established old men = the perfect target for a polite scam.

This is what no one tells you about entrepreneurship: sometimes, the best lessons come from the biggest failures. And my failure had a special twist: I launched my equine saddle-fitting company on a Tuesday. I found out I was pregnant on Wednesday.

*Impeccable* timing. Truly.

## The shortest sprint of my life

Starting a business while pregnant is a bit like launching a product with a fixed, non-negotiable deadline: in 9 months, no matter what, a critical new user will arrive and monopolize 100% of your resources. No buffer. No emergency sprint. Just you, your growing belly, and the naive hope you'll manage to scale before production catches fire.

Spoiler alert: it didn't scale.

But what I learned during that condensed sprint is worth more than any Product Owner bootcamp in the world. Here are my six major lessons, presented with the clear-eyed hindsight of someone who survived the adventure and decided to make it her superpower.

## Lesson 1: Stakeholder Management 101 - The Hard Way

**What I learned:** Trusting recommendations is fine. Checking Google reviews before signing is better.

My accountant was a reference. In my father's network. Me? I was a statistical anomaly: young, female, and in a niche sector (equine saddle-fitting, I mean, who even does that?). The result: he treated me like a second-class file. Non-digitized paperwork piling up, missed deadlines, and a barely-veiled condescension in every exchange. The legal service that followed was the same story. A year later, I'm still doing my own customer support to close the damn thing.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

A toxic or incompetent stakeholder costs more than a good one. As a future PO, **my role is to de-risk the project**, and that starts with choosing the right partners. This experience taught me to create my own evaluation checklist, to look beyond recommendations. I now know how to spot the red flags:
-   Lack of digitalization = risk of disorganization.
-   No proactive communication about blockers = no product culture.
-   And above all: **recommendations are biased social proof**. What works for one user segment can be detrimental to another. You have to validate, test, and maintain a critical eye.

## Lesson 2: User Research Under Extreme Conditions

**What I learned:** Understanding your users is easy in theory. Doing it when you're shy, pregnant, and selling a service in a demanding microcosm is another level.

Before this, I was an engineer. I talked to machines. Entrepreneurship forced me to "farm" communication skills in fast-forward. Every client was a live user research session: Discovery, Retention, Churn analysis. I was on the front lines alone, adapting my service to maximize satisfaction while staying viable.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

User empathy isn't a buzzword. It's a skill you build by forcing yourself out of your comfort zone. As a future PO, I know how to ask the right questions and read between the lines to distinguish a **latent need** (the *'job-to-be-done'*) from an **explicit request**â€”a critical distinction for building a product that delivers real value. Most importantly, I know that the best user research is done continuously, not as a one-off.

## Lesson 3: Marketing & Self-Promotion - Or How to Sell Yourself Without Cringing

**What I learned:** If you don't talk about your product, nobody else will.

Building a compelling website, managing social media as a conversion funnel, creating engaging content, pitching my concept to strategic partners... it was all new. The hardest part? Learning to sell ME. In a trust-based industry, people buy the person as much as the service. In one year, I surpassed the visibility of my established competitors, not by magic, but by iteration: testing post formats, analyzing engagement, and adjusting my tone. It was **artisanal A/B testing**, and it worked.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

An amazing product that remains invisible is a dead product. As a Product Owner, I won't just be responsible for the technical roadmap; I'll also own the positioning, the messaging, and the ability to get stakeholders on board with the vision. Learning to pitch and tell a story that highlights a product's unique value is a strength I built on the ground, forcing myself to sell when I'd rather have been hiding behind a screen.

## Lesson 4: Supply Chain & Vendor Management - Or How to Create Value Through Your Network

**What I learned:** A good product is also a good ecosystem of partners.

Managing supplier relationships is more than just placing orders. It's understanding their constraints, pitching your vision, and negotiating. The partnership I built with **Fairfax Saddles (a high-end English saddler), for example,** wasn't just a commercial victory; it was validation that I could successfully convince established players to work with me.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

A Product Owner orchestrates an ecosystem: tech, business, external partners, APIs... Knowing how to identify the right stakeholders and negotiate win-win collaborations is a strategic skill. The best feature isn't always the one you build in-house; sometimes, it's the one you get through the right partnership at the right time.

## Lesson 5: Self-Awareness as Personal Product-Market Fit

**What I learned:** Loving your industry isn't enough if the job doesn't intellectually fulfill you.

I loved horses and my work. The reality? **I quickly felt I was hitting a ceiling.** My thirst for solving complex problems wasn't being quenched. The work, while fascinating in the field, was too isolating and didn't allow me to fully leverage my strategic skills. I needed to build something that could scale, collaborate with a team, and measure a broader impact.

It was from this realization that **Carhorsel**, the main case study in my portfolio, was born: a project that finally combines everything I am. Tech, business, user impact, teamwork, and intellectual complexity.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

A Product Owner who doesn't understand their own "why" is at risk of building misaligned products. This search for my own **'personal Product-Market Fit'** is what now gives me the clarity to know I can build products that are meaningful for both users and the team. That clarity is worth more than any agile framework.

## Lesson 6: Resilience & Pivoting - Or How to Bounce Back When Everything Falls Apart

**What I learned:** Failure is feedback. Expensive, painful feedback, but feedback nonetheless.

An incompetent accountant, a dragging legal service, exploding costs... On paper, it's a series of failures. In reality, it was a series of accelerated learnings. Shutting down my first company wasn't game over. It was a pivot. A painful pivot that made me more clear-eyed, agile, and resilient.

**What this taught me about Product Management:**

*"Fail fast, learn faster"* is a product mantra, but it's also a life stance. My first company is gone, but I came away with skills and clarity I could not have gained any other way. This ability to bounce back and turn blockers into learnings is my competitive advantage. The real question isn't "Will this fail?" but **"What do we learn when it fails?"**

## Conclusion: Closing One Door to Open a Better One

When I look back at that year of entrepreneurship, I no longer see a failure. I see an intensive bootcamp whose intensity no certification course could ever replicate.

I understand tech. I understand business. I understand people. And I know these three dimensions cannot be treated separately.

My saddle-fitting company is closed, but what it taught me continues to fuel my product vision. And frankly, it might be the best thing that ever happened to me.
